# Joint Gift System - Secure Multi-Party Computation

A secure multi-party computation system based on Oded Goldreich's cryptography book. It uses secure logic gates (XOR, AND) and RSA encryption for confidential computations among multiple parties. Built with Python and Tkinter, it ensures secure bit-splitting and encrypted communication in a joint decision process.

## Features:
- Secure Logic Gates (XOR, AND) for multi-party computation
- RSA encryption for secure communication
- Secure bit-splitting and 4-bit addition
- Oblivious transfer protocol
- Interactive Tkinter-based GUI

## Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Tkinter
- RSA encryption
- Random bit generation
